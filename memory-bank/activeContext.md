# BookTrackr Active Context

*Last updated: 25 May 2025*

---

## Current Project Phase

**Phase**: Initial Memory Bank Setup & Project Foundation
**Status**: Documentation Complete, Ready for Implementation Planning
**Next Phase**: MVP Development Kickoff

## Current Work Focus

### Initial Memory Bank Creation ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Files Created**:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Comprehensive project foundation (pre-existing)
  - `productContext.md` - Product vision and user experience goals
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development setup
  - `activeContext.md` - This file (current work focus)
  - `progress.md` - To be created next

### Memory Bank Structure Established ✅
The complete memory bank hierarchy is now in place:

```
memory-bank/
├── projectbrief.md      # Foundation document (source of truth)
├── productContext.md    # Product vision and UX principles
├── systemPatterns.md    # Technical architecture patterns
├── techContext.md       # Technology stack and tools
├── activeContext.md     # Current work and focus areas
└── progress.md          # Implementation status tracking
```

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Complete Memory Bank Foundation
- [ ] Create `progress.md` to track implementation status
- [ ] Review all memory bank files for consistency
- [ ] Establish current project status baseline

### 2. Project Scaffold Planning
Based on the project brief timeline, Week 1 deliverable is:
> "Project scaffold, CI/CD, auth flow"

**Key components to implement**:
- [ ] Next.js 14 project initialization with App Router
- [ ] TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- [ ] Prisma setup with Neon PostgreSQL
- [ ] Clerk authentication integration
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Development environment configuration
- [ ] Initial project structure and routing

### 3. Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Package.json with all necessary dependencies
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configuration
- [ ] Vitest setup for testing
- [ ] Environment variable templates
- [ ] Local development scripts

## Current Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made ✅
- **Next.js 14 App Router**: Server-first architecture with RSC
- **Vercel Deployment**: Edge-optimized hosting with preview branches
- **Neon + Prisma**: Serverless PostgreSQL with type-safe ORM
- **Clerk Authentication**: Drop-in auth with social providers
- **Vercel KV**: Redis-compatible edge caching

### Design Patterns Established ✅
- **Server Components First**: Minimize client-side JavaScript
- **Edge Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching with stale-while-revalidate
- **Data Normalization**: Consistent book data from multiple APIs
- **Row-level Security**: User-scoped database queries

### Technology Choices Confirmed ✅
- **State Management**: TanStack Query + Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright + @axe-core
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + Logtail + Vercel Analytics

## Key Implementation Patterns to Follow

### 1. File Structure Convention
```
src/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                # Utilities and configurations
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
└── styles/             # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

### 2. Component Architecture
- **Server Components** for static content and data fetching
- **Client Components** only when interactivity is required
- **Shared UI components** following shadcn/ui patterns
- **Progressive enhancement** for better accessibility

### 3. API Design Patterns
- **RESTful route handlers** with proper HTTP methods
- **Server Actions** for form submissions and mutations
- **Middleware** for authentication and request processing
- **Error boundaries** for graceful error handling

## Development Priorities

### Week 1 Focus Areas
1. **Project Foundation**
   - Next.js project setup with TypeScript
   - Database schema design and Prisma configuration
   - Authentication flow with Clerk
   - Basic CI/CD pipeline

2. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Environment configuration
   - Testing framework setup
   - Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Deployment configuration

3. **Initial UI Framework**
   - Tailwind CSS setup
   - shadcn/ui component library integration
   - Basic layout components
   - Theme system (light/dark mode)

### Success Criteria for Week 1
- [ ] Working Next.js application deployed to Vercel
- [ ] User authentication (sign up/sign in) functional
- [ ] Database connection and basic schema migrated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running tests and deployments
- [ ] Development environment fully configured

## Current Blockers & Risks

### No Current Blockers ✅
All foundational decisions have been made and documented.

### Potential Risks to Monitor
1. **API Rate Limits**: Google Books API has 1,000 req/day limit
   - **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching and fallback to Open Library
2. **Serverless Cold Starts**: Database connection latency
   - **Mitigation**: Use Prisma Data Proxy for connection pooling
3. **Scope Creep**: Feature requests beyond MVP
   - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to documented roadmap phases

## Team Communication

### Documentation Updates
- Memory bank files should be updated when:
  - New architectural decisions are made
  - Implementation patterns change
  - User feedback affects product direction
  - Technical constraints are discovered

### Progress Tracking
- `progress.md` will be updated after each major milestone
- `activeContext.md` reflects current sprint focus
- `projectbrief.md` remains the source of truth for scope

## Learning & Insights

### Project Setup Best Practices
- **Memory bank approach** provides excellent continuity across sessions
- **Comprehensive planning** before implementation reduces decision fatigue
- **Clear documentation** of patterns enables consistent development

### Technology Integration Points
- Next.js 14 App Router works well with Clerk for authentication
- Prisma + Neon provides excellent DX for serverless applications
- Vercel platform integration reduces deployment complexity
