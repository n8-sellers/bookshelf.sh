- **Database**: Prisma schema ready, connection verified
- **Authentication**: Live Clerk credentials working
- **Build System**: Clean TypeScript compilation
- **Environment**: All secrets properly configured

## Week 2 Implementation Strategy

### Thin Vertical Slice: Search â†’ Add to Shelf
**Core Flow**: /search page â†’ Book Results â†’ Add to Shelf â†’ Personal Library

**Strategic Decisions**:
- **Dedicated /search page** (not modal) for deep-linking and accessibility
- **Pre-seeded database** with ~1,000 popular books to reduce API calls
- **Write-through caching** for external API results
- **Minimal book detail** view to validate core flow

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Database Foundation (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Create book seeding migration with 1,000 curated books
- [ ] Add full-text search indexes for performance
- [ ] Optimize user_books queries with composite indexes
- [ ] Test migration performance and rollback strategy

#### Phase 2: Search Infrastructure (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Google Books API service with rate limiting
- [ ] Open Library API fallback integration
- [ ] Book data normalization service
- [ ] Hybrid search: local first, external fallback
- [ ] Vercel KV caching for API responses

#### Phase 3: Search UI (Day 5-6)
- [ ] /search page with URL state management
- [ ] Search input with debounced queries
- [ ] Book results grid with covers and metadata
- [ ] Loading states, error handling, empty states
- [ ] Navigation integration with search bar

#### Phase 4: Add to Shelf (Day 7)
- [ ] Server Actions for shelf management
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Basic personal library views
- [ ] Success/error feedback

### Key Technical Decisions

#### URL Structure
```
/search                     # Empty search page
/search?q=harry+potter      # Search results with deep-linking
/dashboard/library          # Personal library views
```

#### Search Strategy
```typescript
// Hybrid search: local database first, then external APIs
1. Search pre-seeded books (fast, no API calls)
2. If insufficient results, query Google Books/Open Library
3. Write-through cache new books to database
4. Return unified, normalized results
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- Full-text search indexes on books table
- Composite indexes for user_books queries
- API response caching with 24h TTL
- Image optimization for book covers

## Success Criteria for Week 2

### Must-Have Deliverables
- [ ] Working /search page with book search
- [ ] Users can add books to three shelves (Want, Reading, Read)
- [ ] Pre-seeded database with 1,000 books
- [ ] Basic personal library views
- [ ] External API integration with fallbacks

### Nice-to-Have Polish
- [ ] Search result pagination
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K)
- [ ] Search suggestions/autocomplete
- [ ] Basic error boundaries

## Current Architecture Status

### âœ… Implemented Patterns
- **Server Components First**: Landing page and dashboard using RSC
- **Authentication Middleware**: Route protection working
- **Database Connection**: Prisma client singleton pattern
- **Theme System**: Next-themes integration complete
- **Component Structure**: Base layout and providers established

### âœ… Technology Stack Verified
- **Next.js 14**: App Router working perfectly
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no compilation errors
- **Tailwind CSS**: Custom design system functional
- **Clerk**: Authentication flow tested and working
- **Prisma**: Schema designed, client generated
- **Neon**: Database connection verified

## Development Environment Status

### âœ… Local Development Ready
- **Server**: http://localhost:3000 running
- **Hot Reload**: Working correctly
- **TypeScript**: Live error checking
- **Tailwind**: JIT compilation working
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets loaded

### âœ… Version Control
- **Git Repository**: Initialized and connected
- **Remote**: Connected to GitHub (bookshelf.sh)
- **Initial Commit**: Foundation code committed
- **Branch**: Currently on main branch

## Risk Mitigation

### API Rate Limits
- **Risk**: Google Books 1,000 req/day limit
- **Mitigation**: Pre-seeded books reduce API calls by ~80%
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage, implement circuit breaker

### Database Performance
- **Risk**: Slow search with large dataset
- **Mitigation**: Full-text search indexes, query optimization
- **Testing**: Performance testing with realistic data volume

### UI Complexity
- **Risk**: Search and shelf management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Incremental development, component isolation
- **Approach**: Build basic functionality first, then enhance

## Learning & Insights from Week 1

### Implementation Successes
- **Memory Bank Approach**: Excellent continuity and planning
- **Next.js 14 + Clerk**: Seamless authentication integration
- **Prisma + Neon**: Excellent developer experience
- **Tailwind + TypeScript**: Rapid UI development

### Technical Discoveries
- Next.js App Router metadata warnings (viewport config)
- Clerk auth prop deprecations (afterSignInUrl â†’ fallbackRedirectUrl)
- Prisma schema design for complex book relationships
- Tailwind CSS custom design token integration

### Week 2 Implementation Notes
- **Thin vertical slice** approach reduces technical risk
- **Pre-seeded database** eliminates cold start problem
- **Dedicated search page** better than modal for MVP
- **Write-through caching** balances performance and data freshness
